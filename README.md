## Pokémon Crystal (Personalized)

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal with some minor QoL changes.

### Improvements
#### Done
* Sprinting/Running/Go Fast with B button (same speed as Bicycle)
* Instant text option
* Only 4 beeps when a pokemon is at low health in battle
* A Portable Pocket PC given by Elms Aide

#### To-Do
* Remove artificial save delay
* Restore GS Ball Celebi Event (may not be needed since i'm playing on VC)

### Bug Fixes
#### Done
* BRN/PSN/PAR catch rate increase changed from 0 to +5
* Moon Ball affects Pokemon that evolve by Moon Stone instead of Burn Heal
* Love Ball now checks for the opposite gender instead of the same gender
* Heavy ball now uses correct weight value for Kadabra, Tauros and Sunflora
* Fast ball now boosts catch rate properly instead of for just 3 pokemon
* In-Battle Ellipses lowered 2px
* Fixed inconsistency in some trainer overworld sprites

#### To-Do
* `HELD_CATCH_CHANCE` has no effect
* Glacier Badge boost doesn't apply in specific scenario

#### Wish to fix
* Battle transitions don't account for enemy level (the fix causes issues when using the Virtual Console emulator, which is what I'm playing on)
